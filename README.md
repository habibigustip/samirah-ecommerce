🛍️ E-commerce App Built with Next.js

This project is an e-commerce web application developed as part of my learning journey with Next.js. It showcases the implementation of real-world features such as dynamic product pages, a shopping cart, responsive UI, and smooth user navigation.

🚀 Tech Stack:
- Next.js – App Router, SSR, SEO-ready pages
- React – Core frontend framework
- Tailwind CSS – Utility-first styling for fast, responsive design
- ShadCN UI – Pre-built, accessible UI components
- React Query – Data fetching and caching
- Context API – For state management (if applicable)
- TypeScript – Type safety

----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
